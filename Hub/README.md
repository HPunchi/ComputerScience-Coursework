# HomeShield
## Overview
As part of my A-Level Computer Science coursework, HomeShield is an app I have created designed to help people monitor and manage their homes. It eliminates the need to buy and install expensive hardware by using users' devices as cameras around their homes or offices.

HomeShield is composed of 2 modules: a HomeShield Hub and a HomeShield Agent.
### HomeShield Hub
Is a website where users will manage their account. It allows them to:
- Add/edit/remove devices which have HomeShield Agent installed. 
- Assign devices to a location eg. kitchen, living room, garage, etc.
- Set automatic watch schedules (or manually activate/deactivate devices)
- View a live view captured from a certain device. 
### HomeShield Agent
Is an executable which must be installed on each device in for it to be used with a HomeShield account. The device must have:
- A functioning webcam or a method to aquire a live video stream
- A stable and secure internet connection during active times
- A reliable power supply if the system is to be run for long periods of time
